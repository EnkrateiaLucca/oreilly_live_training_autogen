'Modern LLM agents are goal-directed systems built around large language models that can plan and act, 
not just chat. They interact with external tools, services, and environments to achieve outcomes, 
iterating through a loop of observing context, planning next steps, taking actions, and using the 
results to refine their approach. Architecturally, they pair an LLM with a function-calling layer for 
tools and APIs, a memory or state store, and policies that constrain behavior. This enables multi-step 
workflows such as analyzing datasets, booking travel, triaging support tickets, or orchestrating business 
processes end to end.\n\nTo stay grounded, agents often augment the model with retrieval so it can consult 
documents, knowledge bases, or the web before answering. Tool use spans calling APIs and databases, browsing, 
and writing or executing code in a sandbox to transform data or validate results. Many implementations 
decompose tasks into subgoals, track intermediate state, and emit structured outputs for downstream systems. 
Orchestrators can coordinate multiple specialized agents (for example, researcher, coder, tester) and hand 
off work, while guardrails enforce schemas, permissions, and organizational policies. Integration is 
typically done through structured function calls, JSON schemas, and event-driven workflows.\n\nDespite 
their versatility, LLM agents have limits: they can hallucinate, mishandle edge cases, and struggle with 
very long-horizon plans or ambiguous goals. Practical deployments rely on safeguards such as permissioning, 
human-in-the-loop review, sandboxed tool execution, rate limits, and continuous evaluation of task success 
and safety. Cost and latency are important, so designers cache results, reuse context, and adapt model size 
to task complexity. Good applications align with agent strengths—information synthesis, routine workflow 
automation, data wrangling, and software assistance—while avoiding high-stakes decisions without oversight. 
Looking ahead, better memory, more reliable planning, and tighter integration with enterprise systems and 
hardware will make agents more capable and trustworthy.'
