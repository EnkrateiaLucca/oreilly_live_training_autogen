      "primary: In a realm that existed just beyond the rim of reality, there lay the Whispering Woods. This forest was cloaked in an aura of enchantment, with trees towering towards the heavens, their trunks spiraled like ancient staircases, and their leaves shimmering with iridescent colors that changed with the time of day. At dawn, they glowed an ethereal gold; at midday, they burned a brilliant emerald; and at twilight, they blushed with shades of rose and lavender.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among those who had heard of the Whispering Woods was a young boy named Finn. He had always been entranced by the stories told by the elders of his village—a place where wishes could bloom like flowers and where the air sparkled with possibility. Yet, these tales came with a warning: the woods were not merely a place of beauty; they were alive, and they could be fickle.\n",
      "\n",
      "One fateful afternoon, driven by an insatiable curiosity, Finn decided to seek out the forest himself. As he crossed the threshold into the woods, the world behind him faded away, replaced by a tapestry of greens and blues that promised both adventure and mystery. Here, sunlight danced through the foliage, crafting intricate patterns on the soft moss-covered ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finn wandered deeper, enchanted by the symphony of chirping birds and the gentle rustle of leaves. Suddenly, he stumbled upon a clearing where a solitary tree stood, its trunk enormous and gnarled, its branches twisting like the hands of a clock. A silver glittering mist curled around its roots, and at its base lay a cluster of pure white flowers that seemed to hum with a soft melody.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawn to the blossoms, Finn knelt beside them. He had heard that the Whispering Woods held a secret: if someone truly needed something, they could wish upon the Heartblossom, the rare flower growing at the foot of the ancient tree. With a deep breath, Finn closed his eyes and whispered his wish: “I want to bring joy to my village.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as the words left his lips, a breeze swept through the clearing, lifting the petals of the Heartblossom into the air. They shimmered, swirling around him before suddenly being engulfed in a gentle light. Finn watched in awe as the glow enveloped him, and suddenly, he found himself filled with a warmth he had never known, a feeling as if laughter danced in his heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Go forth, young one!” a voice echoed softly, seemingly emanating from the very air around him. “Let your joy spread as freely as the wind!”\n",
      "\n",
      "With a newfound spirit, Finn ran back through the forest, the light still shimmering in his chest. As he reached the boundary of his village, he carried the energy of the woods within him, acknowledging the laughter that awaited him.\n",
      "\n",
      "From that day on, he became a beacon of joy in the village. He organized festivals where laughter rang through the streets, filled homes with music, and gathered friends for storytelling evenings under the stars. With each joyous moment he created, the villagers began to remember that happiness was a treasure worth seeking, and soon their lives were enriched with the carefree spirit they had long forgotten.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unbeknownst to them, the magic of the Whispering Woods resonated in every laugh, every song, and every shared moment. The ancient tree continued to watch over Finn, knowing that the true magic of the forest was not just in granting wishes but in nurturing the seeds of joy that lay within each heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "And so, the Whispering Woods remained a timeless treasure, a magical realm of wonder where dreams and laughter intertwined, reminding all who entered that kindness and joy could turn the most ordinary moments into extraordinary memories. As long as the Heartblossom bloomed at the base of the ancient tree, joy would flourish—not just in the woods, but in the hearts of all who dared to wish.\n",

    "[`SelectorGroupChat`](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/stable/reference/python/autogen_agentchat.teams.html#autogen_agentchat.teams.SelectorGroupChat) is a group chat that uses an AI model to intelligently choose the next speaker based on context.\n",

    " - When given a task via run() or run_stream():\n",
    "   1. The model analyzes conversation history and agent profiles to pick the next speaker\n",
    "   2. Selected agent provides a response that's shared with all participants \n",
    "   3. Process repeats until termination condition is met\n",
    "\n",
    " Key features:\n",
    " - By default, prevents same speaker twice in a row (override with allow_repeated_speaker=True)\n",
    " - Can use custom selection function instead of default model\n",
    " - Maintains conversation context between tasks\n",
    " - Call reset() to clear conversation history\n",
    " - Returns TaskResult with full conversation when complete"

    "1. Choose the right team type for your use case:\n",
    "   - RoundRobinGroupChat for structured, turn-based interactions\n",
    "   - SelectorGroupChat for dynamic, context-aware speaker selection\n",
    "   - Swarm for explicit handoffs between agents\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use appropriate termination conditions:\n",
    "   - TextMentionTermination for keyword-based stopping\n",
    "   - MaxMessageTermination for limiting conversation length\n",
    "   - ExternalTermination for manual control\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Reset teams between unrelated tasks to clear conversation history\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use streaming for real-time monitoring of team interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Start with simple teams and add complexity as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that teams add overhead compared to single agents, so use them only when the task complexity justifies multi-agent collaboration."
