      "   - The engineer will write code to process the collected data and categorize papers into different domains of human learning, such as \"Language Learning\", \"STEM Education\", \"Skill Acquisition\", etc.\n",

      "   - The scientist will review the categorized papers to validate the domain classification and provide insights into the specific applications of LLMs in each domain.\n",

      "   - The scientist will write a brief report summarizing the findings from the papers, highlighting significant advancements or novel applications of LLMs in aiding human learning.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Data Collection (Engineer)**:\n",
      "   - The script should include a specific date range to ensure that only papers from the last week are retrieved. This can be done by using the `submittedDate` filter in the arXiv API query.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Data Processing (Engineer)**:\n",
      "   - The engineer should consider using natural language processing (NLP) techniques or manual review to accurately categorize papers into domains, as this may not be straightforward from titles and abstracts alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Data Analysis (Scientist)**:\n",
      "   - The scientist should cross-reference the findings with other databases or sources to validate the domain classification and ensure that the papers are indeed relevant to the topic of LLM applications in human learning.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Table Creation (Engineer)**:\n",
      "   - The markdown table should include a column for the URL to the arXiv paper to provide direct access to the full text. This is crucial for verifiability and further reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Documentation and Reporting (Scientist)**:\n",
      "   - The report should include a methodology section explaining how the papers were selected and categorized, as well as any limitations of the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Review and Revision (Admin and Critic)**:\n",
      "   - The critic should also check for potential biases in the selection and categorization process and suggest ways to mitigate them.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Final Approval (Admin)**:\n",
