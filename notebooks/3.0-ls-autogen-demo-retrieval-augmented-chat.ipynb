    "Retrieval augmentation has emerged as a practical and effective approach for mitigating the intrinsic limitations of LLMs by incorporating external documents. In this blog post, we introduce RAG agents of AutoGen that allows retrieval-augmented generation. The system consists of two agents: a Retrieval-augmented User Proxy agent, called RetrieveUserProxyAgent, and a Retrieval-augmented Assistant agent, called RetrieveAssistantAgent, both of which are extended from built-in agents from AutoGen. The overall architecture of the RAG agents is shown in the figure above.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Retrieval-augmented Chat, one needs to initialize two agents including Retrieval-augmented User Proxy and Retrieval-augmented Assistant. Initializing the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy necessitates specifying a path to the document collection. Subsequently, the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy can download the documents, segment them into chunks of a specific size, compute embeddings, and store them in a vector database. Once a chat is initiated, the agents collaboratively engage in code generation or question-answering adhering to the procedures outlined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy retrieves document chunks based on the embedding similarity, and sends them along with the question to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant.\n",
    "The Retrieval-Augmented Assistant employs an LLM to generate code or text as answers based on the question and context provided. If the LLM is unable to produce a satisfactory response, it is instructed to reply with “Update Context” to the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy.\n",
    "If a response includes code blocks, the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy executes the code and sends the output as feedback. If there are no code blocks or instructions to update the context, it terminates the conversation. Otherwise, it updates the context and forwards the question along with the new context to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant. Note that if human input solicitation is enabled, individuals can proactively send any feedback, including Update Context”, to the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant.\n",
    "If the Retrieval-Augmented Assistant receives “Update Context”, it requests the next most similar chunks of documents as new context from the Retrieval-Augmented User Proxy. Otherwise, it generates new code or text based on the feedback and chat history. If the LLM fails to generate an answer, it replies with “Update Context” again. This process can be repeated several times. The conversation terminates if no more documents are available for the context."

Train 30 seconds and force cancel jobs if time limit is reached.', 'role': 'assistant'}, {'content': 'FLAML (Fast Lightweight AutoML) is a Python library designed for efficient and effective AutoML, enabling automated machine learning. Integrating FLAML with Apache Spark for parallel training can speed up the process, especially when dealing with large datasets.\\n\\nHere\\'s a step-by-step guide to integrate FLAML with Spark for a classification task with a 30-second time limit:\\n\\n### Step 1: Set up the environment\\nEnsure you have the necessary libraries installed. You need `pyspark` and `flaml` at the very least. You can install them using pip if they are not already installed:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install pyspark flaml\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Import the necessary libraries\\n```python\\nfrom pyspark.sql import SparkSession\\nfrom flaml import AutoML\\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\nimport mlflow\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Initialize Spark Session\\n```python\\nspark = SparkSession.builder \\\\\\n    .master(\"local[*]\") \\\\\\n    .appName(\"FLAML-Spark\") \\\\\\n    .getOrCreate()\\n```\\n\\n### Step 4: Load and process the dataset\\nFor demonstration purposes, let\\'s use the Iris dataset.\\n\\n```python\\n# Load the Iris dataset\\niris = load_iris()\\nX, y = iris.data, iris.target\\n\\n# Split the dataset into training and testing\\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\\n```\\n\\n### Step 5: Set up FLAML\\'s AutoML\\n```python\\nautoml = AutoML()\\n```\\n\\n### Step 6: Set up MLflow to track experiments\\nFor dataset tracking and logging:\\n\\n```python\\nmlflow.set_experiment(\"iris_classification\")\\n```\\n\\n### Step 7: Define a function to train the model in parallel\\nTo train the model in parallel using Spark, you\\'ll need to distribute the task. Here, we define a function that will be executed in parallel:\\n\\n```python\\ndef train_model(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test):\\n    with mlflow.start_run():\\n        automl.fit(X_train=X_train, y_train=y_train, task=\\'classification\\', time_budget=30)\\n        best_model = automl.model\\n        mlflow.sklearn.log_model(best_model, \"model\")\\n        mlflow.log_params(automl.best_config)\\n        print(automl.best_estimator)\\n```\\n\\n### Step 8: Parallelize the training process\\nUse `spark.sparkContext` to parallelize the training task.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom pyspark import SparkContext\\n\\nsc = SparkContext.getOrCreate()\\nnum_parallel_tasks = 5  # Define how many parallel tasks you want\\nparallel_tasks = [sc.parallelize([i]).map(lambda x: train_model(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test)) for i in range(num_parallel_tasks)]\\n\\n# Collect the result to force execution\\nresults = [task.collect() for task in parallel_tasks]\\n```\\n\\n### Step 9: Stop the Spark context\\n```python\\nsc.stop()\\n```\\n\\n### Step 10: Evaluate the trained model\\nFinally, you can evaluate the trained model on the test set.\\n\\n```python\\n# Make predictions on the test set\\ny_pred = automl.predict(X_test)\\n\\n# Evaluate the model\\'s performance\\naccuracy = (y_pred == y_test).mean()\\nprint(f\"Accuracy: {accuracy}\")\\n```\\n\\n### Important Notes:\\n1. **Timeout and Job Cancellation:** FLAML will adhere to the time budget (`time_budget=30`), automatically canceling the training if the time limit is reached.\\n2. **Resource Management:** Ensure your Spark cluster has enough resources (CPU, memory) to handle the parallel tasks.\\n3. **MLflow Integration:** MLflow tracks experiment metrics and logs them.
